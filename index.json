I am also a guest researcher in the VeriDis group at Loria in Nancy, in the Automation of Logic group at the Max-Planck-Institut für Informatik in Saarbrücken, and in the Institut für Systemsicherheit of the Universität der Bundeswehr München. I did my PhD at the Chair for Logic and Verification at the Technische Universität München. Before that, I worked as software engineer and documentation manager for Trolltech (now The Qt Company) in Oslo.\nTheorem proving plays a central role in formal methods and, more generally, in theoretical computer science. With my research, I work on strengthening proof automation for general-purpose logics and on making proof assistants more cost-effective to use. A hallmark of my research is the combination of automatic and interactive methods—of human and artificial intelligence. I envision a future in which automatic theorem provers and proof assistants will be routinely used for critical computing infrastructure, for programming language design, and more broadly for research in computer science and mathematics, thereby leading to more trustworthy systems and science.\nSpecifically, my research focuses on the development and use of automatic theorem provers and model finders to find proofs and counterexamples in higher-order logic (Sledgehammer, Nitpick, Nunchaku, and Matryoshka). I am also interested in formalizing classic results and modern research in automated reasoning (IsaFoL) and number theory (Lean Forward). Finally, I develop foundational definitional mechanisms for (co)datatypes and (co)recursive functions.\n","date":1582761600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1582761600,"objectID":"fa26580ff7a551e867b537827c8cc0e9","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am an assistant professor in Theoretical Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

Libra combines a sound forward pre-analysis with an exact backward analysis that leverages the polyhedra abstract domain to provide definite fairness guarantees when possible, and to otherwise quantify and describe the biased input space regions. The analysis is configurable in terms of scalability and precision. We equipped Libra with new abstract domains to use in the pre-analysis, including a generic reduced product domain construction, as well as search heuristics to find the best analysis configuration. We additionally set up the backward analysis to allow further parallelization. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on neural networks trained on a popular dataset in the fairness literature.","tags":["Fairness","Neural Networks","Reduced Abstract Domain Products","Abstract Interpretation","Static Analysis"],"title":"Reduced Products of Abstract Domains for Fairness Certification of Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Denis Mazzucato","baldan","padoin"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
